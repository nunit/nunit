Feature: NUnit should support TeamCity

Scenario Outline: The NUnit sends TeamCity service messages when I run successful test for NUnit2 framework
	Given Framework version is <frameworkVersion>	
	And I have added successful method as SuccessfulTest to the class Foo.Tests.UnitTests1 for foo.tests	
	And I have created the folder mocks
	And I have added the reference ..\..\..\..\packages\NUnit.2.6.4\lib\nunit.framework.dll to foo.tests
	And I have copied the reference ..\..\..\..\packages\NUnit.2.6.4\lib\nunit.framework.dll to folder mocks
	And I have compiled the assembly foo.tests to file mocks\foo.tests.dll	
	And I have added the assembly mocks\foo.tests.dll to the list of testing assemblies
	And I want to use CmdArguments type of TeamCity integration
	When I run NUnit console
	Then the exit code should be 0
	And the output should contain TeamCity service messages:

Scenario Outline: The NUnit sends TeamCity service messages when I run it for parallelizable tests
	Given Framework version is <frameworkVersion>	        
	And I have added SuccessfulParallelizable method as SuccessfulParallelizable1 to the class Foo.Tests.UnitTests1 for foo1.tests	
	And I have added SuccessfulParallelizable method as SuccessfulParallelizable2 to the class Foo.Tests.UnitTests1 for foo1.tests	
	And I have added SuccessfulParallelizable method as SuccessfulParallelizable3 to the class Foo.Tests.UnitTests1 for foo1.tests	
	And I have added attribute [assembly: NUnit.Framework.Parallelizable] to the assembly foo1.tests
	And I have added attribute [NUnit.Framework.Parallelizable] to the class Foo.Tests.UnitTests1 for foo1.tests
	And I have added NUnit framework references to foo1.tests
	And I have added SuccessfulParallelizable method as SuccessfulParallelizable4 to the class Foo.Tests.UnitTests1 for foo2.tests	
	And I have added SuccessfulParallelizable method as SuccessfulParallelizable5 to the class Foo.Tests.UnitTests1 for foo2.tests	
	And I have added SuccessfulParallelizable method as SuccessfulParallelizable6 to the class Foo.Tests.UnitTests1 for foo2.tests	
	And I have added attribute [assembly: NUnit.Framework.Parallelizable] to the assembly foo2.tests
	And I have added attribute [NUnit.Framework.Parallelizable] to the class Foo.Tests.UnitTests1 for foo2.tests
	And I have added NUnit framework references to foo2.tests
	And I have created the folder mocks	
	And I have copied NUnit framework references to folder mocks
	And I have compiled the assembly foo1.tests to file mocks\foo1.tests.dll	
	And I have compiled the assembly foo2.tests to file mocks\foo2.tests.dll	
	And I have added the assembly mocks\foo1.tests.dll to the list of testing assemblies
	And I have added the assembly mocks\foo2.tests.dll to the list of testing assemblies
	And I want to use CmdArguments type of TeamCity integration
	And I have added the arg workers=10 to NUnit console command line
	And I have added the arg agents=10 to NUnit console command line
	When I run NUnit console
	Then the exit code should be 0
	And the Test Run Summary should has following:
	| field        | value |
	| Test Count   | 6     |
	| Passed       | 6     |
	| Failed       | 0     |
	| Inconclusive | 0     |
	| Skipped      | 0     |

	| frameworkVersion |
	| Version45        |
