    <summary>NUnit is a unit-testing framework for all .Net languages with a strong TDD focus.</summary>
    <description>NUnit features a fluent assert syntax, parameterized, generic and theory tests and is user-extensible. A number of runners, both from the NUnit project and by third parties, are able to execute NUnit tests.&#10;&#13;This package includes the NUnit 3.0 framework assembly, which is referenced by your tests. You will need to install version 3.0 of the nunit-console program or a third-party runner that supports NUnit 3.0 in order to execute tests. Runners intended for use with NUnit 2.x will not run 3.0 tests correctly.&#10;&#13;This is an beta release, but is ready for production use for people with prior NUnit experience.</description>
