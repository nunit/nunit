Shouldly
========
Shouldly is an assertion framework which focuses on giving great error messages when the assertion fails while being simple and terse.

This is the old *Assert* way: 

    Assert.That(contestant.Points, Is.EqualTo(1337));

For your troubles, you get this message, when it fails:

    Expected 1337 but was 0

How it **Should** be:

    contestant.Points.ShouldBe(1337);

Which is just syntax, so far, but check out the message when it fails:

    contestant.Points should be 1337 but was 0

It might be easy to underestimate how useful this is. Another example, side by side:

    Assert.That(map.IndexOfValue("boo"), Is.EqualTo(2));    // -> Expected 2 but was 1
    map.IndexOfValue("boo").ShouldBe(2);                    // -> map.IndexOfValue("boo") should be 2 but was 1

**Shouldly** uses the code before the *ShouldBe* statement to report on errors, which makes diagnosing easier.
