NUnit would also not be possible without the numerous contributions from the community. A 
complete list of contributors since NUnit migrated to Git can be 
[found on GitHub](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/graphs/contributors).

Earlier versions of NUnit were developed by Charlie Poole, James W. Newkirk, Alexei A. Vorontsov, 
Michael C. Two and Philip A. Craig.

We would also like to thank the following people for their contributions and support: 
Jamie Cansdale, Cvetomir Todorov, Doug de la Torre, David White, Ethan Smith, Al Gonzalez, 
Ron Jeffries and Rob Jeffries. A special acknowledgment needs to be sent to Kent Beck 
and Erich Gamma because without their efforts none of this would have been possible.
