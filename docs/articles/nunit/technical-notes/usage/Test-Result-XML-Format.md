 * **Attributes**
    * **type** The type of suite represented by this element. Currently supported types are Assembly, TestSuite, TestFixture, 
    * **id** The unique id of this test. Coded as "mmm-nnn" where the part before the hyphen represents the assembly and the part after it represents a test in that assembly. Currently, mmm and nnn are ints, but that is merely an accident of the implementation and should not be relied on.
    * **name** The display name of the test as generated by NUnit.
    * **fullname** The full name of the test as generated by NUnit.
    * **classname** The full name of the class (fixture) representing this test. Only present if `type` is equal to "TestFixture".
    * **testcasecount** The number of test cases contained, directly or indirectly, in this suite.
    * **runstate** An indicator of whether the suite is runnable. Value may be NotRunnable, Runnable, Explicit, Skipped or Ignored. NotRunnable means there is an error in how the test is expressed in code, for example, the signature may be wrong. Explicit, Skipped and Ignored are set by attributes on the test.
    * **result** The basic result of the test. May be Passed, Failed, Inconclusive or Skipped.
    * **label** Additional labeling information about the result. In principle, this may be any string value and is combined with the result to give a more precise reason for failure. Currently, NUnit may use the following labels in combination with the Failure result: Error, Cancelled or Invalid. It may use the following labels in combination with a Skipped result: Ignored or Explicit. Additional values may be added in future releases or supplied by extensions, so code that processes a result file should be prepared to deal with any label or none at all.
    * **site** Optional element indicating where a failure occurred. Values are Test, SetUp, TearDown, Parent or Child. Default is Test and the attribute does not normally appear in that case.
    * **start-time** The UTC time that the suite started.
    * **end-time** The UTC time that the suite ended.
    * **duration** The duration of the suite in seconds, expressed as a real number.
    * **total** The total number of test cases executed under this suite.
    * **passed** The number of test cases that passed.
    * **failed** The number of test cases that failed.
    * **inconclusive** The number of test cases that were inconclusive.
    * **skipped** The number of test cases that were skipped.
    * **asserts** The number of asserts executed by the suite, including any nested suites or test cases. Since asserts may be executed in OneTimeSetUp and in ActionAttributes, this number can be greater than the total of the asserts for the test cases.
